# My Recipes

A personal project that allows users to manage their favorite recipes. Users will also be able to look up their recipes based on the ingredients they have available.

I'm using this project for learning purposes and to get comfortable with C# development and some good practices and technologies such as:

* Azure DevOps
* Clean Architecture
* MediatR & CQRS
* AutoMapper
* Dapper
* REST API
